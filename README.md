# Data Science Projects
This repository contains a collection of data science projects that showcase various aspects of my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Each project is organized in its own directory, with detailed explanations, code, and results.
## [Project 1: Bio-Signal Analysis for Smoking](https://github.com/Vivek-Harisree/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Bio-Signal%20Analysis%20for%20%20Smoking)
The management wants to build an intelligent system from the data to determine the presence or absence of smoking in a person through biosignals. Given a person’s information, I build a machine learning model that can classify the presence or absence of smoking
## [Project 2: Credit Card Classification](https://github.com/Vivek-Harisree/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Credit%20score%20classification)
Over the years, the company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce the manual efforts. Given a person’s credit-related information, I must build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score.
## [Project 3: Customer churn project for telecom company 'NEO'](https://github.com/Vivek-Harisree/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Customer%20churn%20project%20for%20telecom%20company%20'NEO')
You are the Data Scientist at a telecom company “Neo” whose customers are churning out to  its competitors. I have to analyse the data of the company and find insights and stop the  customers from churning out to other telecom companies.
## [project 4: Flight Booking price prediction](https://github.com/Vivek-Harisree/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Flight%20Booking%20price%20prediction)
The objective is to analyze the flight booking dataset obtained from a platform which is used to book flight tickets. A thorough study of the data will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that will be of enormous value to passengers. Apply EDA, statistical methods and Machine learning algorithms in order to get meaningful information from it.
## [Project 5: Stroke prediction](https://github.com/Vivek-Harisree/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Stroke%20prediction)
In this project, we aim to develop and compare machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a stroke occurrence based on various health-related features. Using a dataset that includes information on factors such as age, gender, medical history, and lifestyle choices, we will build models to help identify 
individuals at higher risk of stroke
